# hyprsplit
awesome / dwm like workspaces for [hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland)

A complete rewrite of [split-monitor-workspaces](https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces) that attempts to fix the issues I experienced with it. Improvements include:
- Workspaces on each monitor are determined by that monitor's ID
- Ability to grab windows that get lost in invalid workspaces when disconnecting monitors
- Dispatcher to swap all windows in active workspaces between two monitors
- Better handling of workspace params. For example `empty` will work properly and select an empty workspace on the current monitor.

## Installation
Requires Hyprland version >=`v0.36.0`

### Hyprpm
Load plugins on startup by putting exec-once = hyprpm reload -n in your hyprland config.
```
hyprpm update
hyprpm add https://github.com/shezdy/hyprsplit
hyprpm enable hyprsplit
```

### Manual
Make sure you have the Hyprland headers installed (see [hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Plugins/Using-Plugins/#manual))

If you are compiling for a numbered version of Hyprland, check for a commit pin in hyprpm.toml, and reset the plugin to the second hash in the pair.

Compile the plugin:
```
make all
```
Finally add the following to your config  `plugin = /path/to/hyprsplit/hyprsplit.so`, or run `hyprctl plugin load /path/to/hyprsplit/hyprsplit.so`

## Configuration
### Options

| name | description | type | default |
|---|---|---|---|
| num_workspaces | Number of workspaces on each monitor | int | 10 |
| persistent_workspaces | if true, will make workspaces on each monitor persistent (they will always exist and will not be destroyed when empty) | bool | false |

### Dispatchers
| Dispatcher | Description | Params |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
| split:workspace | Replacement for `workspace` | workspace |
| split:movetoworkspace | Replacement for `movetoworkspace` | workspace OR `workspace,window` for a specific window  |
| split:movetoworkspacesilent | Replacement for `movetoworkspacesilent` | workspace OR `workspace,window` for a specific window |
| split:swapactiveworkspaces | Swaps all windows in active workspaces between two monitors | two monitors separated by a space |
| split:grabroguewindows | Finds all windows that are in invalid workspaces and moves them to the current workspace. Useful when unplugging monitors. | none |

Some of Hyprland's workspace parameters are treated differently by the plugin's dispatchers:
-  `1`,`2`, or `3`: number on current monitor
-  `+1` or `-1`: relative on current monitor, no looping
-  `r+1` or `r-1`: relative on current monitor, with looping
-  `e+1`, `e-1`: relative on current monitor, excluding empty workspaces, no looping
-  `m+1`, `m-1`: relative on current monitor, excluding empty workspaces, with looping
- `empty`: empty workspace on current monitor

All other workspace params will be treated the same as however Hyprland normally treats them.

If you are using hy3 you should use `hy3:movetoworkspace` instead of `split:movetoworkspace`, it has compatibility with hyprsplit.

### Example Config
```
plugin {
    hyprsplit {
        num_workspaces = 6
    }
}

bind = SUPER, 1, split:workspace, 1
bind = SUPER, 2, split:workspace, 2
bind = SUPER, 3, split:workspace, 3
bind = SUPER, 4, split:workspace, 4
bind = SUPER, 5, split:workspace, 5
bind = SUPER, 6, split:workspace, 6

bind = SUPER SHIFT, 1, split:movetoworkspacesilent, 1
bind = SUPER SHIFT, 2, split:movetoworkspacesilent, 2
bind = SUPER SHIFT, 3, split:movetoworkspacesilent, 3
bind = SUPER SHIFT, 4, split:movetoworkspacesilent, 4
bind = SUPER SHIFT, 5, split:movetoworkspacesilent, 5
bind = SUPER SHIFT, 6, split:movetoworkspacesilent, 6

bind = SUPER, D, split:swapactiveworkspaces, current +1
bind = SUPER, G, split:grabroguewindows
```
